# Satellite-Imagery-Ananlysis
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and satellite imagery to monitor and analyze environmental conditions in Chennai. Using data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, along with pollution and climate datasets, we aimed to assess patterns in air quality, land cover, and urban heat. The data was preprocessed and then analyzed through several predictive models, including Random Forest and XGBoost for classification tasks such as land cover detection, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based pollution and heat map analysis. These models allow for accurate classification, segmentation, and predictive analysis, offering insights into urban expansion, vegetation health, and pollution trends. CNNs were particularly valuable in processing and interpreting spatial patterns in satellite imagery, enabling us to detect subtle environmental changes over time.
## Introduction
The use of satellite imagery has transformed our ability to monitor and predict environmental phenomena with unprecedented precision. By capturing a continuous flow of data on the Earth's surface, satellite technology enables scientists and policymakers to analyze critical indicators like air quality, temperature, rainfall, and pollution levels over large geographic regions. This capability is especially valuable for environmental forecasting, where rapid insights are crucial for responding to climate change, managing natural resources, and preparing for extreme weather events.
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have further boosted the accuracy and speed of satellite imagery analysis, enabling real-time monitoring and forecasting capabilities. By combining satellite data with predictive models, researchers can now make more reliable forecasts of pollution levels, temperature anomalies, and rainfall likelihoods. These insights play a critical role in guiding policies for environmental protection, urban planning, and disaster preparedness, highlighting the transformative potential of satellite data for sustainable development and public health.
## Machine Learning and Statistical Models
### Land Surface Temperature Prediction Using LSTM Networks
Predicting temperature accurately is crucial for various applications, from agriculture and energy management to disaster preparedness and public health. Satellite data, with its continuous and comprehensive view of Earth's surface, has become an invaluable source for temperature prediction. Among the machine learning techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are particularly effective for handling time-series data, such as temperature records, because of their ability to retain information over long sequences. By combining satellite data with the predictive power of LSTMs, temperature prediction can be enhanced in accuracy and resolution, offering detailed insights into climate patterns and supporting a variety of environmental decision-making processes.
### Pollution Monitoring Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Pollution monitoring is a critical component of environmental management, public health protection, and climate change mitigation. With the rapid urbanization and industrialization seen across the globe, monitoring pollution levels accurately and in real-time has become increasingly important. Satellite
data, with its capability to observe large and remote areas, has become an essential source for monitoring pollution at various scales, from local to global. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly suited to analyze such spatial data due to their ability to capture and interpret patterns within images, such as the distribution of pollutants over a region.
