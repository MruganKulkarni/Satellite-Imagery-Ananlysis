# Satellite-Imagery-Ananlysis
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and satellite imagery to monitor and analyze environmental conditions in Chennai. Using data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, along with pollution and climate datasets, we aimed to assess patterns in air quality, land cover, and urban heat. The data was preprocessed and then analyzed through several predictive models, including Random Forest and XGBoost for classification tasks such as land cover detection, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based pollution and heat map analysis. These models allow for accurate classification, segmentation, and predictive analysis, offering insights into urban expansion, vegetation health, and pollution trends. CNNs were particularly valuable in processing and interpreting spatial patterns in satellite imagery, enabling us to detect subtle environmental changes over time.
